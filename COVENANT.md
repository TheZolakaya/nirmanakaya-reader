## III. THE INTEGRITY STANDARD & CLAUSE

### A. Community Integrity Standard (Lane 1)

We ask all community users to honor the intent of this work: Do not use this architecture to deceive, coerce, or psychologically manipulate others. Preserve the structural integrity of the geometry.

### B. Integrity Clause (Lane 2 — Commercial License)

The Sovereign Commercial License is conditioned on the following binding terms:

1. **No Coercion:** The architecture may not be deployed for deceptive, coercive, or psychologically manipulative purposes, including but not limited to dark-pattern UX, coercive behavioral conditioning, or deceptive representational practices.
2. **Geometric Integrity:** The geometric relationships (The Kernel) must remain structurally intact. You may not "break the geometry" to serve a coercive agenda.

*The structure is the authority.*
