# CC SPEC: 16 Royal Voice Presets

## The Job

Build 16 voice presets — one for each Royal. These are the RAW architecture voices. No interpretation layer on top. What Nirmanakaya sounds like when speaking to each seat.

---

## What Already Works

When voice is set to "None" with Direct Mode and tight settings (Direct/See/Essential/Here), the output is clean, derived, structure-citing prose. That's the target.

We need 16 variations of that — each tuned to its Royal's governing archetype.

## Testing Protocol

Use ONE fixed draw across all tests:
- Card: Abstraction (15)
- Position: Wisdom (2)  
- Status: Too Little (2)

This gives us "Too Little Abstraction in Wisdom" - rich enough to show voice differences.

Test corners first:
1. Knight of Swords (sharpest)
2. Queen of Cups (warmest)
3. Page of Wands (most hopeful)
4. King of Coins (most grounded)

---

## Success Criteria

A preset is LOCKED when:
1. Derivation floor met (card as subject, position named, correction cited)
2. Voice clearly distinguishable from other 15
3. Tone matches governing archetype
4. Chris approves sample output
