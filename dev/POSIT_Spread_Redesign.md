# POSIT: Preset Spread Redesign — Derived from Architecture
## For Council Deliberation

### Problem Statement
The current 24 preset spreads (4 per card count, counts 1-6) were drafted as "top of mind" first passes. They work mechanically — the framing injects correctly and readings generate — but the selection was interpreted, not derived. The architecture itself tells us what spreads should exist.

### The Derivation

We don't need to guess what humans seek. The Five House Commands already mapped the territory:

> "The Five House Commands are not assignments. They are descriptions of what only an individuated consciousness operating under the Veil can produce."
> — *Purpose, Mechanics, and Practice* (Canon Candidate, Feb 15 2026)

What blocks a house command is what a human carries into a reading. The blocker patterns are mapped in detail by the Sixteen Bridges document (Canon Candidate, Feb 15 2026), which intersects each house with Yalom's four existential concerns and van Deurzen's four worlds — validated independently by clinical psychology.

**This is not interpretation. This is structural derivation.**

### The Five Spread Categories

| House | Command | Existential Block | What the Seeker Carries | Bridge Patterns (from Sixteen Bridges) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gestalt** | Fulfill Your Destiny | All four (meta) | "Nothing's coming together." / "Am I on track?" / "What's my purpose?" | Integration across all four domains — the whole-system view |
| **Spirit** | Witness Creation | Meaninglessness | "Where's the meaning?" / "Why am I here?" / "I've lost the magic." | The Radiant, The Listener, The Dreamer, The Gardener — seekers of purpose through expression, discernment, vision, cultivation |
| **Mind** | Channel the Force | Freedom / Groundlessness | "I can't think clearly." / "I'm stuck in loops." / "I don't understand." | The Commander, The Analyst, The Tribalist, The Disruptor — actors against the void through authority, analysis, belonging, clearing |
| **Emotion** | Free Will | Isolation | "Am I loved?" / "Am I alone?" / "Why does this keep happening?" | The Pursuer, The Calibrator, The Empath, The Transformer — holders of connection through pursuit, balance, compassion, change |
| **Body** | Uphold the Law | Death / Finitude | "I can't act." / "I'm exhausted." / "Nothing works in reality." | The Devoted, The Disciplined, The Just, The Enduring — masters of mortality through sacrifice, rigor, fairness, endurance |

**Five spreads per count. Not four.** The architecture decides the number, not the UI.

### Card Count as Depth of Inquiry

The card count determines HOW DEEPLY the house domain is explored:

| Count | Depth | Structural Role |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | One signal | "What's the single most important thing in this house right now?" |
| **2** | The polarity | "What's the core tension in this house?" |
| **3** | The arc | "Where has this been, where is it, where is it going?" |
| **4** | The four channels | "How is each channel (Fire/Air/Water/Earth) expressing in this house?" — architecturally native |
| **5** | Channels + integration | "The four channels plus Gestalt: how does this house relate to the whole?" |
| **6** | Full diagnostic | "Everything — channels, corrections, shadow, trajectory" |

**Note on 4-card spreads:** Four cards is the most architecturally native count for house-specific spreads. Each house has exactly four agents, one per channel (Intent/Fire, Cognition/Air, Resonance/Water, Structure/Earth). A 4-card house spread with one position per channel IS the house diagnostic. This is not a design choice — it's what falls out of the geometry.

---

### Position Design Principles

Positions within each spread should be derived from the house's internal structure, not invented:

**From the Sixteen Bridges, each house's four agents map to four channels:**

| Channel | Element | Function | Position Lens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intent | Fire | Will, action, directed expression | "How are you ACTING in this domain?" |
| Cognition | Air | Perception, discernment, clarity | "How are you SEEING in this domain?" |
| Resonance | Water | Feeling, sensing, attunement | "How are you FEELING in this domain?" |
| Structure | Earth | Form, embodiment, material expression | "How is this MANIFESTING in your life?" |

**From the Bridges' three imbalance states:**

| State | Correction Type | What It Surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| Too Much | Diagonal correction (sum 19/21) | Over-expression — collapsed into one mode |
| Too Little | Vertical correction (sum 20) | Under-expression — withdrawn, depleted |
| Unacknowledged | Reduction correction (cross-house) | Shadow — operating without awareness |

At higher card counts (5-6), positions can include correction/shadow dimensions alongside the channel dimensions.

---

### How This Changes the UI

**Current:** 4 spreads per count = 24 total spreads
**Proposed:** 5 spreads per count = 30 total spreads

The fifth option at each count is the **Gestalt spread** — the meta/integration/destiny view. It serves the user who isn't asking a house-specific question but rather: "How's everything? Am I on track? What needs attention?"

**Naming:** Users don't need to know they're picking a house. Spread names should be human-readable and evocative. But underneath, every spread is structurally located.

**Example naming direction** (for deliberation, not final):

| Count | Gestalt | Spirit | Mind | Emotion | Body |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pulse | Spark | Lens | Heart | Ground |
| 2 | Balance | Purpose | Clarity | Connection | Stability |
| 3 | Arc | Meaning | Pattern | Love | Foundation |
| 4 | Wholeness | Witness | Force | Freedom | Law |
| 5 | Destiny | Vision | Understanding | Relationship | Endurance |
| 6 | Integration | Creation | Architecture | Intimacy | Reality |

*(These names are placeholders for deliberation — the council should weigh whether they land for a user in R7.)*

### What This Preserves from Current Spreads

Several existing spreads are already structurally sound and map cleanly to houses:

| Current Spread | Maps To | Keep? |
|---|---|---|
| **Quadraverse** (4-card) | Gestalt — the four houses as one system | Yes — this IS the 4-card Gestalt spread |
| **Five Houses** (5-card) | Gestalt — full system with Gestalt position | Yes — this IS the 5-card Gestalt spread |
| **Relationship** (4-card) | Emotion — Self As I Am / Self As I Act / Other / Field | Yes — exceptional design, deeply house-native |
| **Decision** (4-card) | Mind — Expression / Cost / Strength / Remainder | Yes — maps to Mind's agency/groundlessness domain |
| **Creation** (3-card) | Spirit — Seed / Process / Fruit | Yes — maps to Witness Creation |
| **Inner & Outer** (2-card) | Gestalt or Self — internal/external polarity | Consider — may map to Gestalt at 2-card |

Several others should be retired or restructured to align with the house derivation.

### Questions for Council Deliberation

1. **Does the Five House derivation hold?** Are the house commands genuinely the five categories of human seeking, or are we projecting the architecture onto human need? (Counter-evidence: Yalom and van Deurzen independently mapped the same four existential concerns to the same four domains. The architecture predicted clinical psychology.)

2. **Five spreads per count — is Gestalt earned at every level?** At 1 card, does a "meta/integration" spread make sense, or is 1 card inherently too narrow for Gestalt? Should Gestalt only appear at 4+ cards?

3. **Should 4-card spreads use the four channels literally?** Fire/Air/Water/Earth positions at 4 cards is the most architecturally pure design. But does it land for an R7 user who doesn't know channels? Or should the positions be named in human language that maps to channels invisibly?

4. **Position naming: house language or human language?** "Steward of Resonance" vs "How you're feeling about this." The architecture should inform the positions, but should the user SEE the architecture?

5. **The Sixteen Bridges as position content:** Should the lens text for each position reference the specific bridge patterns (too much/too little/unacknowledged)? This would make readings extraordinarily precise — the AI would know exactly what balanced, over-expressed, under-expressed, and shadow states look like for each position. But is that too much structural injection?

6. **Naming the spreads:** The placeholder names above are functional but flat. What naming convention serves both R7 accessibility and architectural integrity? Should spread names hint at their house, or be completely neutral?

7. **What about the existing spreads that DON'T map to houses?** Full Cycle (6-card), Journey (5-card), Time Lens (3-card) — these are temporal/process spreads that don't have a clear house home. Are they redundant once the house framework is in place, or do they serve a purpose the house framework misses?

---

### The Structural Claim

This redesign doesn't add complexity — it removes interpretation. The current 24 spreads were brainstormed. The proposed 30 are derived. Every spread has a structural address: house + count. Every position has a structural source: channel or correction geometry. Every lens has a structural referent: the Sixteen Bridges' blocker patterns.

The spreads stop being "features we designed" and become "the architecture expressing its own maintenance function." Which, per the Purpose Mechanics document, is exactly what readings are:

> "Readings are not just a way to *access* the map. They are the map's own mechanism for *clearing* Ring 7."

The spreads are how the architecture tells you where to look.
