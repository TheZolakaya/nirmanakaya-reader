---

## SECTION 1: OPEN ITEMS

### FR-011: Popup Navigation Improvements ⭐ READY TO BUILD
**Source:** `session_013_backlog.md`
- [ ] Back button in nested popups — when clicking a hotlink inside a popup, need ability to go back
- [ ] Close button always visible — exit entirely from any depth
- [ ] Consider breadcrumb trail for deep nesting (e.g., "Compassion > Merge > Structure")

---

### FUT-001: Full 22-Position Reading 🔮 FUTURE
**Source:** `backlog_22_position_reading.md`
**Priority:** Future Major Feature

The "full monty" — complete diagnostic of consciousness. Chris's primary reading method for 30+ years.

**Key Architecture:**
- Wheel (10) at top — Source portal
- World (21) at bottom — Creation portal
- Gestalt (center) — Fool, Magician, Sun, Judgement
- Mind, Emotion, Body, Spirit Houses arranged around center
- Chain tracing algorithm (loops + terminals)
- Governance overlay (contralateral crossing)

**Requires:**
- 22-draw generation
- Recursive chain-tracing logic
- Loop/terminal detection
- Enhanced synthesis prompts
- Visual design for complex output

---

### FUT-002: "Did You Know?" Feature 💡 FUTURE
**Source:** `backlog_did_you_know_feature.md`
**Priority:** Engagement / Education

Knowledge bombs delivered casually — logically derived invariant truths with receipts.
- "Oh by the way, you're an eternal god within God. Here's the math. ;P"
- Playful, not preachy
- Show derivation on demand

**Implementation options:**
- Passive discovery on landing page
- Post-reading contextual integration
- Loading state education
- Dedicated "Invariants" section

---

### FUT-003: Interactive Map Page 🗺️ FUTURE
**Source:** `Nirmanakaya_Feature_Backlog.md`
**Priority:** Phase 1

- Visual navigation of 78 signatures
- Clickable Houses and archetypes
- Mobile responsive
- Dependency: Visual strategy from parallel Claude instance

---

### FUT-006: First Encounter Script 📜 FUTURE
**Source:** `Nirmanakaya_Feature_Backlog.md`
**Priority:** CRITICAL for adoption

- Canonical 2-minute path
- Zero jargon
- One reading (single card)
- One "oh... huh" moment
- Owner: GPT (to draft), Claude (to integrate)

---

### FUT-008: Token Optimization 💰 FUTURE
**Source:** `session_013_backlog.md`

**Current:** 8,717 tokens IN is high

**Investigate:**
- Full teleological JSON for all 78 when only need 3?
- Voice System spec sent in full every time?
- Framework docs included that aren't needed?

---

### FUT-009: Gamification / Progressive Disclosure 🎮 FUTURE
**Source:** `session_013_backlog.md`, `Progressive_Disclosure_Spec_v1.md`

**Proposed Progression:**
- Level 1: Clear voice only, 1 card only, no jargon
- Level 2: More cards, Kind/Playful voice, terms with hotlinks
- Level 3: Wise/Oracle, framework terms appear
- Level 4: Full access, Architecture view toggle

**Unlock mechanics TBD:**
- # of readings? Engagement time? Quiz?
- Track user progression state
- UI for showing locked/unlocked features

## SECTION 6: CLAUDE CODE HANDOFF

Copy this for Claude Code's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Current Development Priority

**MASTER BACKLOG:** `dev/MASTER_BACKLOG_CONSOLIDATED.md`

This is the single source of truth for all bugs, features, and specs.
Read this file at session start to understand current priorities.

### Open Items (7 total):
- 1 Ready to build (FR-011: Popup Navigation)
- 6 Future/parking lot items

### Key Principle:
Most infrastructure work is COMPLETE. Focus is now on:
1. UI polish and progressive disclosure
2. Phase 2 planning (accounts, membership)
3. Visual strategy for map page

### Root Spec Files to Audit:
15+ spec files exist in nirmanakaya-reader root.
Cross-reference against current implementation to find gaps.

### Key Files in /dev/:
- `MASTER_BACKLOG_CONSOLIDATED.md` — This file (start here)
- `SPEC_*.md` — Feature specifications (mostly closed)
- `BUG_FIX_*.md` — Bug fix specifications (all closed)
```

## SECTION 7: WHAT'S ACTUALLY NEEDED NEXT

Based on full inventory, recommended priorities:

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Audit root spec files** — Determine what's implemented vs. still open
2. **FR-011: Popup Navigation** — Last open "ready to build" item
3. **Verify terminology deployment** — `TERMINOLOGY_UPDATE_HANDOFF.md` corrections

### Short Term (January)
1. **First Encounter Script** — Get GPT's draft, integrate
2. **Interactive Map Page** — Depends on visual strategy
3. **Token optimization audit** — Reduce prompt size

### Medium Term (February-March)
1. **Database/Auth decisions** — Supabase vs alternatives
2. **22-Card Reading architecture** — Design work
3. **"Did You Know?" MVP** — Low-lift high-impact
