# Complete Bound Correction Lookup Table

**CANONICAL REFERENCE - Use this table, do not calculate**

This table contains ALL 40 Bounds × 3 imbalanced states = 120 corrections.
The AI MUST use this exact lookup. No calculation permitted.

## CHANNEL CROSSING RULES

| Status | Channel Crossing |
|--------|------------------|
| Too Much (2) | Intent↔Cognition, Resonance↔Structure |
| Too Little (3) | Intent↔Resonance, Cognition↔Structure |
| Unacknowledged (4) | Intent↔Structure, Cognition↔Resonance |

**Number Mirror:** Target number = 11 - Source number

## VERIFICATION

**Formation (3 of Pentacles/Structure) + Unacknowledged:**
- Structure → Intent (channel cross for status 4)
- Number 3 → Number 8 (11 - 3 = 8)
- Intent Channel, Number 8 = **Command**
- ✓ Table confirms: Command (8♦)

**This table is authoritative. The AI MUST use the provided correction name.**
