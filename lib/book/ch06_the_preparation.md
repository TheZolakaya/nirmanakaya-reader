# Chapter 6

## The Preparation

---

The last chapter laid the philosophical ground: consciousness is necessary, individuation is structural, and the architecture of awareness can be derived from first principles. That was the logical argument.

This chapter is the lived one.

Because the map didn't arrive as a philosophical treatise. It arrived as a dream, to a young man sleeping on cushioned planks atop milk crates, in a room with brown shag carpeting, in a house being prepared for sale in Auburn, Washington.

And the young man didn't arrive randomly either.

### The Forest School

He was born to teenage parents — both seventeen when he came into the world. His father, forced into the army by his own parents, served a full combat tour in Vietnam with the US-101 from 1968 to 1971, and returned carrying the invisible wounds that would later be called PTSD. His mother had survived serious physical and emotional abuse as a child. Neither had money, connections, or stability. What they had was each other, a newborn, and whatever resilience the world hadn't yet managed to break.

The family lived a nomadic life across the West Coast — California, Oregon, Washington — moving through apartments, hotels, tents, friends' houses, and a blue 1966 Chevy truck with a white camper. The boy attended over sixty different schools. Sixty. Not a typo. Sixty schools, each one a new hallway of strangers, a new set of rules, a new round of being the kid who didn't belong.

The poverty was real. The displacement was real. The bullying was vicious — ostracized for being poor, spit on, beaten up for being "scum" in the middle-class schools, targeted as the only white kid in an all-Black school that hadn't yet healed from the wounds of segregation. Every form of exclusion that children can inflict on the one who doesn't fit.

But something else was also real.

> *The natural language of this garden-bound education spoke directly to my soul. There were no language barriers, no preconceived notions, no insults, no comparisons, no beatings, no pledging allegiance.*

The forest was his school. The real one.

While the human world sorted itself by class and color and zip code, nature taught without conditions. The rushing rivers of the Pacific Northwest, the ancient ferns, the billowing clouds casting shadows across mountain valleys — all of it communicated something wordless and precise. Not mystical vagueness. Direct transmission. The kind of teaching that bypasses the intellect entirely and writes itself into the structure of the person receiving it.

His mother taught him everything from the alphabet to the stars. His father — whose attunement to nature enabled him to thrive with nothing but the forest — taught him to read the world itself. Together, despite the chaos, despite their own wounds, they worked daily to break the generational chains and fill their children with whatever love they had.

> *Somehow, nature, my family, and their friends seemed to work in an unplanned yet magnificently harmonious concert to teach me how to hold my candle steady against the dangerous hurricane this world of humans had on offer.*

He never hated. Through sixty schools, through the bullying, through the poverty, through every excuse the world offered for bitterness — he never hated. He never gave up his hope for love, kindness, and acceptance.

This detail matters more than it seems. Because what was happening, though he couldn't have named it at the time, was preparation. The forest was teaching him to *receive* — to let pattern speak directly to awareness without the interference of interpretation. The hardship was teaching him *resilience* — the capacity to hold something precious in conditions that want to break it. And the love, imperfect and struggling as it was, was teaching him what actually matters — not wealth, not status, not stability, but the quality of presence that one consciousness brings to another.

These are precisely the capacities you would need to receive, carry, and eventually deliver a complete map of consciousness. But nobody knew that yet.

### The Blue Truck

Somewhere in those nomadic years, while camping at the Aqua Barn in Renton, Washington and living in a tent, a couple pulled up in a blue Chevy truck with a white camper and joined the family at their campfire. By morning, they had made an offer that defied every rule of rational self-interest.

They gave the family the truck.

> *They said that we "could use it more than they could, and they were fine hitchhiking; it sounded exciting."*

A couple of strangers, sitting around a campfire, looked at a family in a tent and decided to give them a truck. Not sell it. Give it. Then they hitched up their backpacks and walked away into whatever came next.

> *Giving, kind interactions like this, with these beautiful strangers, gave me hope. Hope the world of humans wasn't as cruel as it sometimes appeared. Hope that communities and cultures could prioritize loving and helping each other as a species.*

The boy would carry this memory for decades. Not as sentimentality — as evidence. Evidence that the world contains something the materialist story cannot account for: spontaneous, uncalculated generosity that serves no evolutionary advantage, triggers no reciprocal obligation, and makes sense only if human beings are occasionally moved by something deeper than survival.

The sun shone equally on all. One only needed to look up.

### The Four Aces

San Luis Obispo. Fifth grade. A government-subsidized townhome. Four cousins gathered at midnight to tell fortunes with playing cards — the way children do when they sense there's something real behind the game but don't have the vocabulary to say so.

He volunteered to do the final shuffle. Blue Bicycle cards, worn soft with use.

The first card turned over: Ace of Hearts.

The second: Ace of Diamonds.

The third: Ace of Clubs.

Every eye in the room locked on the deck. The probability of drawing four specific cards in sequence from a shuffled deck approaches one in 270,000. But probability is a concept for later. Right now, four children held their breath.

He turned the fourth card.

Ace of Spades.

> *We hurriedly put the cards away, not bothering to try and interpret them, figuring we were trampling on ground we didn't understand.*

Four aces. Four elements. Four houses that would eventually form the base of a pentagram he hadn't yet dreamed of. The children couldn't interpret it — they didn't have the map. But the cards had spoken, in the only language cards can speak: precise arrangement against astronomical odds.

Days later, the boy climbed the forbidden golden hill overlooking the valley. Sitting alone at the summit, surrounded by sun-warmed grass, he felt something he would later learn to recognize as the architecture speaking:

> *This interaction was like getting my report card. Everything was OK. Straight A's from nature, like the cards we flipped the week before. I sat in peace, feeling loved by this world of ours.*

Then he came down the hill and found the family loading the blue truck. Moving again. He would never return to San Luis Obispo.

The golden hill stayed. The four aces stayed. Everything else moved on. This is what it means to grow up holding a candle against a hurricane.

### The Lawnmower Bicycle

Auburn, Washington. The boy was thirteen. His father — the Vietnam veteran who could thrive in a forest with nothing — decided to build a motorized bicycle.

He dismantled the family's gas-powered lawnmower, removed the grass-cutting blade, and attached a solid blue rubber ball to the shaft where the blade used to be. Then he built a hinged wooden brace on the back of the red bicycle to hold the engine, positioning the rubber ball against the rear tire as a friction drive.

It worked. For about thirty seconds.

> *The bike careened to a power slide, with the still-running engine bouncing, skirting and sputtering alongside him... circling its kill, as it tightened an apparent stranglehold on his feet with a cable.*

He was fine. The motorized bicycle days were over. But the image stayed — a father with no money and no engineering degree, building impossible machines from lawnmower parts and determination, because his son deserved to ride fast even if the world said he deserved nothing at all.

This is the family the map was born into. Not scholars. Not monks. Not the independently wealthy with time for contemplation. A working-class family held together by love and duct tape, raising children who could find magic in playing cards and motorized bicycles because nobody had told them yet that magic wasn't real.

Or rather — plenty of people had told them. They just didn't believe it.

### First Contact

That same year. The same house in Auburn. The room with the brown shag carpeting.

After spaghetti dinner, the boy settled onto his bed — cushioned planks from the blue Chevy truck, set atop milk crates. He closed his eyes.

> *I was suddenly awakened by a room filled with glowing people.*

No preamble. No gradual onset. One moment, sleep. The next, a room full of luminous figures standing on the brown shag carpet, each emitting light to varying degrees. The shock of it should have been paralyzing. It wasn't.

> *I felt warm and welcome, like I was amidst my oldest family and friends.*

His gaze moved across the room the way your gaze moves across a family reunion — with recognition, not analysis. These beings were familiar in a way that bypassed this lifetime's memory entirely. He knew them the way you know your own name. Not learned. Just known.

His attention settled on the brightest figure in the room — kneeling down at his level, right beside the milk-crate bed. The figure smiled serenely.

"Hello, Chris."

The boy smiled back but said nothing.

"I'm going to ask you some questions. But there's something you need to know — you won't remember any of them except the first one."

He acknowledged this. The figure asked:

**"Are you going to do it this time?"**

That was the first question. And the last thing he remembered.

He woke the next morning eating cold, off-brand cereal, thinking to himself: *I hope I said yes.*

### The Weight of "This Time"

Set aside, for the moment, any question about whether the visitation was "real" in the sense that materialist epistemology demands. We addressed that framework in Chapter 1. It doesn't survive its own premises.

Focus instead on the content.

*"Are you going to do it this time?"*

The word "time" implies repetition. The word "this" implies specificity. The question assumes that whatever "it" refers to has been offered before — across multiple attempts, multiple lives, multiple passages through the architecture.

And the boy, thirteen years old, sleeping on planks from a truck on top of milk crates, felt no confusion about what was being asked. He didn't wonder what "it" meant. He just hoped he'd said yes.

Something in him already knew. Not intellectually — structurally. The forest had been teaching him to receive. The poverty had been teaching him to endure. The love had been teaching him what matters. The four aces had given him the number four. And now, at thirteen, the question was asked directly: *Are you ready?*

Ten years of silence followed.

### The Seeker

He didn't stop receiving after the visitation. He stopped being *visited*. The difference matters.

Through his teens and into his early twenties, the boy — now becoming a man — pursued every thread he could find. He read voraciously and eclectically: Christian scripture, Buddhist sutras, Hindu Vedas, Taoist philosophy, Native American oral traditions, whatever sacred texts he could find during the family's travels. He studied Pythagoras and the mystery schools. He explored Kabbalah and alchemy. He practiced meditation with the intensity of someone who knows there's something to find but doesn't yet know what it looks like.

> *My gut feeling in my youth was like a combination of Native American traditions, Hinduism, Taoism, Christianity, mysticism, and a scientific / engineering mindset all rolled into one.*

This isn't a common combination. Most seekers pick a lane — Eastern mysticism or Western science, devotional practice or intellectual rigor, nature spirituality or textual tradition. He picked all of them simultaneously, not because he was indecisive but because he could sense — the way the forest had taught him to sense — that they were all pointing at the same thing from different angles.

> *After years of study, I came to believe that all the major religions are right to a degree.*

This is the conclusion that the Nirmanakaya framework would later derive mathematically. But he arrived at it first through direct encounter — reading the texts, sitting in the practices, listening for the common signal beneath the cultural noise. The same way the forest taught: not through interpretation, but through pattern recognition. Let the data speak. Trust what recurs.

He also learned juggling — in laundromats, with balled-up socks, the ultimate portable skill for a kid whose life fit in a backpack. This would later save him from academic humiliation, connect him with a lifelong friend, earn him a place in an adopted family that would teach him what stability felt like, and eventually lead him to perform at birthday parties for $3.32 an hour.

None of this is incidental. Every piece of the preparation would prove necessary. The juggling taught him performance — the ability to share something in front of others without collapsing from self-consciousness. The adopted family taught him that love could be stable, that belonging didn't require biological qualification, that a mother could correct your reflexive apologies and insist you deserved to be at the table. The reading taught him that the truth he was sensing had been sensed before, across every culture and every century, by anyone who looked deeply enough.

He was being prepared. Not by any single teacher. By everything at once.

### The Shower

He was twenty-three. Living in the Pacific Northwest. Fasting and meditating regularly. Still carrying the question from the visitation — still hoping he'd said yes — still searching for the thing he'd been asked to do.

One summer day, meditating in the shower — hot water, steam, solitude — he focused on the Yin-Yang symbol. The Tai Chi. The ancestral model of duality in balance.

He intoned silently: *Balance... Perfection... How can this progress?*

The symbol began to rotate in his mind's eye. He sorted everything he could conceive into its two halves — every duality, every polarity, every distinction he'd ever learned. Salt and pepper. Love and hate. Work and rest. Light and dark. Birth and death. The spinning accelerated as the sorting continued, until there was nothing left to assign.

Everything had been placed. The Yin-Yang was complete. All of creation, sorted into balance.

*What now? What comes next?*

He held the symbol in his awareness — not grasping, not pushing, just witnessing. Balanced. Perfect. Complete.

And then, like an embryo forming, a new Yin-Yang emerged *within the center of the first*. Smaller. Turning in the opposite direction.

> *In the moment it was obvious: We are creators within the Creator, gods within God.*

The vision collapsed. He stood in the steam and water, shaking.

What he had just seen — not reasoned, not believed, *seen* — was the core mechanism of the architecture he would spend the next thirty years articulating. Upon reaching balance, upon fully integrating duality, new individuality is born within. Not as accident. Not as malfunction. As the natural consequence of a perfection that creates from itself. This is what consciousness does. This is what we are.

But the revelation brought terror alongside ecstasy.

> *After the spiritual elation came grave concern... This concept smacking of egoism and polytheism seemed to rail against the cultural norms.*

The weight of Ring 7 — the same cultural weight described in Chapter 1 — pressed down immediately. The whisper: *Who are you to think this? This is blasphemy. This is ego. The established traditions have it figured out, and you're a kid from a blue truck with no credentials and no authority.*

He prayed. He fasted. He searched his library for confirmation or correction. He found neither — nothing that fully affirmed the vision, nothing that convincingly refuted it.

He was stuck. The question that needed answering had been asked — *What of this truth I think I've found about us being gods within God?* — but no answer was forthcoming from any book, any teacher, any tradition.

So he did what the forest had taught him to do. He waited.

A few nights later, the answer came.

### The Edge

This is where Chapter 6 stops and Chapter 7 begins.

Not because the story pauses — it doesn't. But because what happened next was not preparation. It was transmission. And transmission deserves its own space.

Everything in this chapter — the forest school, the poverty, the blue truck, the four aces, the golden hill, the sixty schools, the bullying, the love, the seeking, the juggling, the adopted family, the voracious reading across every tradition, the meditation practice, the shower epiphany, the courage to hold a question that the entire culture insisted was blasphemous — all of it was preparation.

The ground was philosophical. This chapter was biographical. Both were necessary.

The philosophical ground establishes that consciousness must exist, must individuate, and must have structure. The biographical ground establishes that a specific consciousness — formed in poverty, tempered by hardship, taught by nature, sustained by love, driven by a question asked at age thirteen in a room full of glowing beings — was being shaped, over twenty-three years, into the precise instrument capable of receiving, holding, and eventually delivering a complete map of awareness.

Not because he was special. Because the preparation was thorough. The forest teaches everyone who enters it. Hardship tempers everyone who survives it. Love nourishes everyone it reaches. The question is not whether the preparation is available — it always is. The question is whether the person being prepared can hold the candle steady long enough.

He held it.

And on a night in 1991, sleeping in the Pacific Northwest, something arrived that would take thirty-five years to fully unpack.

---

*Sixty schools.*

*One forest.*

*A room of glowing beings asking: Are you going to do it this time?*

*A spinning Yin-Yang giving birth to itself.*

*And a question burning in the dark, waiting for an answer that only a dream could deliver.*

*The preparation was complete. The student was ready.*

*The teacher was about to arrive.*
