## The DSM-5 Mapping

---

Chapter 17 showed the architecture's patterns in physics, biology, and neuroscience. This chapter shows them in psychology — and the correspondence is more precise than any other domain.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5-TR), is psychology's most comprehensive taxonomy of pathological states. It organizes mental illness into twenty-two diagnostic domains.

The Nirmanakaya architecture contains twenty-two positions.

The mapping is one-to-one. Each diagnostic domain corresponds to a specific archetype in a specific state of displacement. And the architecture does something the DSM cannot: it provides a structural corrective pathway for each condition.

### The Four Statuses as Diagnostic Framework

Chapter 12 introduced the four transient states — Balanced, Too Much, Too Little, and Unacknowledged. These are not personality types or permanent labels. They are orientations — current relationships between consciousness and its own capacity at a given position.

Reframed as a diagnostic framework, they map directly to the temporal structure of psychological disturbance:

| Status | Temporal Orientation | Psychological Pattern | Creation Quality |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Balanced** | Present (Now) | Health, flow, authentic engagement | Creating consciously |
| **Too Much** | Future-projected | Anxiety, mania, obsession, excess | Creating from what hasn't happened |
| **Too Little** | Past-anchored | Depression, withdrawal, deficiency | Creating from what already passed |
| **Unacknowledged** | Dissociated (Shadow) | Denial, suppression, unconscious patterns | Creating without awareness |

This is the Nowism framework applied to clinical psychology. Balanced consciousness operates in the present — the only temporal location where creation actually occurs. Too Much consciousness has projected into the future, generating anxiety and excess. Too Little consciousness has anchored in the past, generating depression and withdrawal. Unacknowledged consciousness has dissociated from its own process, creating the shadow states — conditions that operate without the person's awareness.

Every psychological condition, in this framework, is a displacement from Now. And the correction is always the same direction: return to present-tense engagement with actual experience.

### The Twenty-Two Domains

The DSM-5-TR organizes its diagnostic categories into domains that map, one-to-one, onto the twenty-two positions of the architecture. The mapping follows the house structure — disorders cluster by the domain of consciousness they affect.

**Gestalt House — Disorders of Identity:**

The Gestalt House governs selfhood — the coherence of the observer. Its disorders involve disturbances to identity itself.

| Position | Archetype | DSM-5-TR Domain |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 | Potential (The Fool) | Gender Dysphoria |
| 1 | Will (The Magician) | Sexual Dysfunctions |
| 19 | Actualization (The Sun) | Personality Disorders |
| 20 | Awareness (Judgement) | Medication-Induced Disorders |

Potential — pure capacity before direction — maps to Gender Dysphoria: the experience of fundamental identity not matching its vessel. The capacity exists; the form doesn't fit. Will — the first act of directed identity — maps to Sexual Dysfunctions: the directional force of embodied identity unable to express its intent. Actualization — identity fully expressed — maps to Personality Disorders: the self that has crystallized into a pattern that no longer serves it. Awareness — the mirror that sees itself seeing — maps to Medication-Induced Disorders: consciousness whose capacity for self-recognition has been altered by external agents.

**Spirit House — Disorders of Purpose and Direction:**

Spirit governs aspiration, the inner compass, the sense of where one is going. Its disorders involve disturbances to purpose and directional capacity.

| Position | Archetype | DSM-5-TR Domain |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2 | Wisdom (High Priestess) | Impulse-Control Disorders |
| 3 | Nurturing (The Empress) | Paraphilic Disorders |
| 17 | Inspiration (The Star) | Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders |
| 18 | Imagination (The Moon) | Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders |

Wisdom — the capacity to discern before acting — maps to Impulse-Control Disorders: discernment failing, action preceding perception. Nurturing — sustained care that grows things — maps to Paraphilic Disorders: care and desire misdirected, the cultivation instinct attached to inappropriate objects. Inspiration — aspiration at full radiance — maps to Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: the search for luminosity through external agents rather than internal process. Imagination — creative flow returning to source — maps to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: the creative-integrative capacity locked in repetitive loops, unable to complete its cycle.

**Mind House — Disorders of Cognition and Agency:**

Mind governs modeling, thought, agency — the capacity to build navigable representations of reality. Its disorders involve disturbances to cognitive function.

| Position | Archetype | DSM-5-TR Domain |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 4 | Order (The Emperor) | Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders |
| 5 | Culture (The Hierophant) | Dissociative Disorders |
| 15 | Abstraction (The Devil) | Neurodevelopmental Disorders |
| 16 | Breakthrough (The Tower) | Neurocognitive Disorders |

Order — the framework that makes thought possible — maps to Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: the structural framework of cognition fractured, reality-modeling unable to maintain coherence. Culture — shared understanding passed through relationship — maps to Dissociative Disorders: the connection between self and its own experienced reality severed, continuity of identity lost. Abstraction — pure concept, pattern stripped of content — maps to Neurodevelopmental Disorders: the capacity for cognitive abstraction and modeling atypically structured from early development. Breakthrough — the structure that destroys structure — maps to Neurocognitive Disorders: cognitive capacity deteriorating, previous mental architecture losing its structural integrity.

**Emotion House — Disorders of Mood and Feeling:**

Emotion governs valuation, felt meaning, the capacity to weight experience. Its disorders involve disturbances to affective function.

| Position | Archetype | DSM-5-TR Domain |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 6 | Compassion (The Lovers) | Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders |
| 7 | Drive (The Chariot) | Depressive Disorders |
| 13 | Change (Death) | Anxiety Disorders |
| 14 | Balance (Temperance) | Bipolar Disorders |

Compassion — the structural capacity for felt connection — maps to Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders: the relational capacity damaged by events that overwhelmed the capacity to connect. Drive — passionate forward momentum — maps to Depressive Disorders: the emotional engine stalled, momentum lost, the chariot stopped. Change — the transformation that allows new to emerge from old — maps to Anxiety Disorders: the future-oriented dread of transformation, the resistance to the change that consciousness knows is coming. Balance — centered harmony between opposing forces — maps to Bipolar Disorders: the equilibrium between poles lost, consciousness oscillating between excess and deficit without finding center.

**Body House — Disorders of Somatic Experience:**

Body governs form, structure, physical manifestation — the densest domain of conscious experience. Its disorders involve disturbances to embodied function.

| Position | Archetype | DSM-5-TR Domain |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 8 | Fortitude (Strength) | Somatic Symptom Disorders |
| 9 | Discipline (The Hermit) | Sleep-Wake Disorders |
| 11 | Equity (Justice) | Feeding and Eating Disorders |
| 12 | Sacrifice (The Hanged Man) | Elimination Disorders |

Fortitude — structural resilience, the capacity to endure — maps to Somatic Symptom Disorders: the body expressing what consciousness cannot process in other domains, structural capacity overwhelmed and signaling through physical symptoms. Discipline — focused method and practice — maps to Sleep-Wake Disorders: the disciplined rhythm of conscious and unconscious engagement disrupted. Equity — fair measure and balance — maps to Feeding and Eating Disorders: the body's capacity for equitable self-nourishment distorted. Sacrifice — the willing release of what has served its purpose — maps to Elimination Disorders: the body's letting-go function unable to operate.

**Portals — Threshold Conditions:**

The two portals are not archetypes but thresholds. Their corresponding diagnostic domains are equally liminal.

| Position | Portal | DSM-5-TR Domain |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 10 | Source (Wheel of Fortune) | Other Mental Disorders |
| 21 | Creation (The World) | Other Conditions of Clinical Attention |

Source — the ingress portal — maps to the catch-all diagnostic category for conditions that don't fit elsewhere: the threshold between classification systems, where existing categories fail. Creation — the egress portal — maps to conditions that warrant clinical attention but don't constitute mental disorders: the boundary between pathology and the wider field of human concern.

### Displacement Expressions

Each archetype's disorder manifests differently depending on which status displacement is present. This creates a three-dimensional diagnostic grid: archetype x house x displacement state.

For example, take Compassion (position 6, Emotion House):

| Displacement | Expression | Clinical Pattern |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Too Much** | Connection overwhelm | Hypervigilance, flooding, boundary dissolution, codependency |
| **Too Little** | Connection withdrawal | Emotional numbing, avoidance, inability to trust, isolation |
| **Unacknowledged** | Connection shadow | Re-enactment of trauma patterns without awareness, projecting past wounds onto present relationships |

Or take Order (position 4, Mind House):

| Displacement | Expression | Clinical Pattern |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Too Much** | Structural rigidity | Paranoid ideation, delusional systems — too much structure, imposed on reality |
| **Too Little** | Structural collapse | Disorganized thinking, loss of coherent reality-modeling — not enough structure |
| **Unacknowledged** | Structural fracture | Negative symptoms, flat affect — the structural framework operating in shadow, without the person's conscious participation |

The architecture doesn't just name the disorder. It locates the displacement — Too Much, Too Little, or Unacknowledged — and that location determines the corrective path.

### The Correction Pathways

This is where the architecture does something that the DSM cannot. The DSM diagnoses. It classifies. It names the condition with precision and rigor. But it does not contain within its own structure a corrective mechanism. Treatment comes from outside the taxonomy — from clinical experience, pharmaceutical research, and therapeutic traditions.

The Nirmanakaya architecture contains its correction pathways within its own geometry. The three duality systems from Chapter 12 provide them:

| Displacement | Correction Path | Mechanism | Geometric Operation |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Too Much** | Diagonal partner | Counter-tension | Polarity (sum = 19 or 21) |
| **Too Little** | Vertical partner | Restoration | Recursion (sum = 20) |
| **Unacknowledged** | Reduction partner | Illumination | Awareness (same digit sum) |

**Too Much:** The person is pushing too hard in the direction of this archetype — excess, inflation, future-projected anxiety about this capacity. The diagonal partner provides counter-tension: a different archetypal identity in the same house that creates productive friction, pulling the excess back toward center. Too Much Inspiration (addiction — seeking luminosity through external substances)? The diagonal partner is Wisdom (discernment): the counter-force that asks "is this genuine light, or are you mistaking heat for illumination?"

**Too Little:** The person is not reaching their capacity in this archetype — deficiency, withdrawal, past-anchored stagnation. The vertical partner provides restoration: the same identity at a different horizon, offering what's missing from the same source. Too Little Drive (depression — the emotional engine stalled)? The vertical partner is Change (transformation): the reminder that stillness is not permanence, that the chariot can move again because movement is its nature.

**Unacknowledged:** The person is operating this archetype without awareness — shadow patterns running beneath conscious attention, creating consequences the person cannot see. The reduction partner provides illumination: a maximally different vantage point — different house, different element, different process stage — that throws light on what's hidden. Unacknowledged Order (structural fracture operating in shadow)? The reduction partner is the archetype at the greatest geometric distance in the hypercube, offering the perspective most foreign to the shadow's hiding place.

### What This Means

The mapping is not offered as a replacement for clinical psychology. It is offered as a structural framework that contextualizes what clinical psychology observes.

When a clinician diagnoses Major Depressive Disorder, the architecture agrees with the diagnosis and adds: this is Drive displaced toward Too Little — the emotional engine anchored in the past, creating from what already happened rather than what is happening now. The correction pathway is the vertical partner: Change. Not "think positive" — but encounter the structural opposite of stagnation within the same domain, the archetype whose very definition is transformation.

When a clinician diagnoses Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the architecture agrees and adds: this is Change displaced toward Too Much — the capacity for transformation projected forward, generating dread about future transformations that haven't occurred. The correction pathway is the diagonal partner: Compassion. Not "stop worrying" — but encounter the force of connection that grounds the future-projected anxiety in present relationship.

The architecture provides what the DSM's taxonomic structure cannot: a geometric rationale for why specific interventions work for specific conditions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy works for anxiety because it brings future-projected consciousness back to present engagement — the same correction the architecture prescribes for Too Much displacement. Trauma therapy works through relational reconnection because it restores the Compassion archetype's capacity for safe connection — the same correction the architecture prescribes for Too Little displacement at position 6.

The architecture doesn't replace the therapist. It provides the therapist with a map of *why* the intervention works — grounding clinical intuition in geometric structure.

### The Twenty-Two Correspondence

Twenty-two DSM-5-TR diagnostic domains. Twenty-two positions in the architecture. The same count.

This correspondence is either coincidence or evidence. The chapter cannot adjudicate between those options — that remains an interpretive choice. But it can point out that the mapping is not forced. The disorders cluster naturally by house — identity disorders in the Gestalt House, mood disorders in the Emotion House, cognitive disorders in the Mind House, somatic disorders in the Body House, purposive disorders in the Spirit House. The assignments make structural sense: they map the disorder to the position whose healthy function the disorder disrupts.

Depression disrupts Drive. Schizophrenia disrupts Order. Trauma disrupts Compassion. Addiction disrupts Inspiration. Each disorder is a displacement of a specific capacity in a specific domain — and the architecture predicts which capacity and which domain by the position's structural identity.

If the architecture were arbitrary — a symbolic system imposed on consciousness — there would be no reason for clinical psychology's most rigorous taxonomy to map onto it with this precision. The fact that it does is evidence, not proof. But it is evidence that the architecture is describing real structure — structure that psychology discovers when it classifies what goes wrong in the same domains that the architecture describes when it maps what consciousness does when it's working.

### The Bridge to Healing

The DSM-5-TR is diagnostic. It tells you what is wrong. The architecture is navigational. It tells you where you are and what direction to move.

The combination provides something neither offers alone: a diagnostic system with built-in geometric correction pathways. Name the condition, locate the displacement, identify the correction partner, and the geometry itself suggests the direction of healing.

Not as prescription. Not as replacement for clinical judgment. As structural support for the work that therapists, healers, and individuals already do — grounded in the same mathematics that produced the Seals, the same geometry that organizes the pentagram, the same operations of Polarity and Recursion that generate the architecture itself.

Healing is de-noun-ification. Chapter 15 said it: Ring 7 is where verbs freeze into nouns, and healing is the thaw. The DSM-5 mapping shows exactly which verb has frozen at which position and in which direction the thaw needs to proceed.
