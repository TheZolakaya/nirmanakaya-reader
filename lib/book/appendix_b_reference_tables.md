|-------|------|--------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Gestalt | Fire (0) | Water (20) | Air (19) | Earth (1) | Seed |
| Spirit | Air (2) | Earth (3) | Fire (17) / Water (18) | — | Fruition |
| Mind | Fire (4) | — | Water (5) / Air (15) | Earth (16) | Fruition |
| Emotion | Water (6) | Earth (13) | Fire (7) | Air (14) | Seed |
| Body | Water (11) | Fire (12) | Earth (8) | Air (9) | Fruition |

## Table 4: The Four Channels

| Channel | Element | Suit | Mode | Question |
|---------|---------|------|------|----------|

## Table 5: The Four Process Stages

| Stage | Quality | Yang/Yin | Character |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Seed | Yang-pure | Initiating | Where potential first differentiates into specific intent |
| Medium | Yin-in-Yang | Developing | Where the seed encounters relationship and begins to elaborate |
| Fruition | Yin-pure | Completing | Where the planted seed reaches its full expression |
| Feedback | Yang-in-Yin | Integrating | Where the cycle folds back and feeds what was learned into the next beginning |

## Table 6: The Seven Rings

| Ring | Name | Structural View | Teleological View |
|------|------|----------------|-------------------|

| 1 | Source (Ingress) | The portal through which consciousness enters | The threshold of individuation |
| 2 | Gestalt (Identity) | The self that persists across change | The minimum viable identity |
| 3 | Body (Structure) | Manifestation and form | Directive Fields — the 20 Spiral Operators |
| 4 | Emotion (Felt Resonance) | Valuation and connection | Spiral Messengers — guides, synchronicity |
| 5 | Mind (Focal Agency) | Modeling and pattern | Incarnated Consciousness — the agent under the Veil |
| 6 | Spirit (Emergent Direction) | Orientation and aim | Reflected Systems — culture, religion, technology |
| 7 | Creation (Egress/Residue) | Where unfinished creation goes | Creative exhaust awaiting reintegration |

        ──────  ───────  ────  ─────
Fire       17       7      4     12    = 40
Air         2      14     15      9    = 40
Water      18       6      5     11    = 40
Earth       3      13     16      8    = 40
        ──────  ───────  ────  ─────
           40      40     40     40
```

All rows sum to 40. All columns sum to 40. All sixteen toroidal 2x2 blocks sum to 40. Four corners sum to 40.

## Table 12: The Pentagram House Mapping

```
            Gestalt (Aether)
               ★
              / \
             /   \
            /     \
     Mind ★       ★ Emotion
    (Air)  \     /  (Water)
            \   /
             \ /
     Spirit ★───★ Body
    (Fire)        (Earth)
```

Gestalt at apex. Spirit and Body as feet. Mind and Emotion as arms. The upright pentagram represents consciousness properly oriented. The trace order determines the Seal's column sequence.

## Table 14: The Complete 78 Signature Count

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Archetypal Signatures | 20 | Positions 0-9, 11-20 (the verbs of consciousness) |
| Portal Signatures | 2 | Source (10), Creation (21) — thresholds, not archetypes |
| Bounds | 40 | 20 archetypes × 2 polarities (Inner/Outer) |
| Agents | 16 | 16 manifest archetypes × 1 externalized expression |
| **Total** | **78** | **The complete vocabulary of conscious experience** |

Note: Gestalt archetypes (0, 1, 19, 20) have bounds but no agents. Portals (10, 21) have neither bounds nor agents.
