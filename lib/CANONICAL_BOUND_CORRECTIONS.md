# Canonical Bound Corrections Reference

**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Status:** CANONICAL - This is the authoritative source for all Bound corrections
**Authority:** Chris's direct specification

---

## THE LOGIC

Bound corrections follow the Archetype correction path with polarity flip:

1. **Find the Bound's associated Archetype**
2. **Get that Archetype's correction partner:**
   - Too Much → Diagonal partner
   - Too Little → Vertical partner
   - Unacknowledged → Reduction partner
3. **Flip polarity:** Inner (1-5) → Outer (6-10), Outer (6-10) → Inner (1-5)
4. **Return the correction Archetype's bound at the flipped polarity**

### Polarity Reference
- **Inner (1-5):** Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Outer (6-10):** 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
