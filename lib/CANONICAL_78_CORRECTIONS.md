# Canonical 78 Corrections Reference

**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Status:** CANONICAL - This is the authoritative source for ALL 78 signature corrections and growth opportunities
**Authority:** Chris's direct specification

---

## THE LOGIC

### For Imbalanced States (Too Much, Too Little, Unacknowledged)
Archetypes correct to their duality partner:
- **Too Much → Diagonal partner**
- **Too Little → Vertical partner**
- **Unacknowledged → Reduction partner**

For Bounds and Agents: Follow the associated Archetype's correction path with **polarity flip**.

### For Balanced State (Growth Opportunity)
Balance isn't a destination — it's a launchpad. When balanced, the archetype points to its **growth partner**:

- **12 Off-Diagonal Archetypes → Transpose Partner** (lateral growth through reflection)
- **4 Diagonal Archetypes → Polarity Anchor** (vertical growth through elemental opposition)

For Bounds and Agents: Follow the associated Archetype's growth partner with **polarity flip**.

### Polarity Reference
- **Inner:** Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5 / Page, Knight
- **Outer:** 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 / Queen, King

## PART VII: DEVELOPMENTAL GUIDANCE FOR BALANCED STATES

### Transpose Pair Guidance Examples

**Order (Emperor) Balanced → Wisdom (High Priestess):**
"Your structure is sound — your systems work. Now, learn to receive. Structure without receptivity becomes rigidity."

**Wisdom (High Priestess) Balanced → Order (Emperor):**
"Your receptivity is open — you see what is. Now, give it form. Reception without structure remains formless."

**Drive (Chariot) Balanced → Imagination (Moon):**
"Your momentum is unstoppable — you charge forward. Now, let the dream inform the direction. Momentum without vision is just velocity."

**Imagination (Moon) Balanced → Drive (Chariot):**
"Your vision is crystalline — you see what could be. Now, move toward it. Vision without momentum remains fantasy."

**Sacrifice (Hanged Man) Balanced → Nurturing (Empress):**
"You've learned to let go — surrender is natural. Now, learn to grow. Surrender without cultivation is emptiness."

**Nurturing (Empress) Balanced → Sacrifice (Hanged Man):**
"Your garden flourishes — you know how to tend. Now, learn what to prune. Cultivation without surrender becomes overgrowth."

### Polarity Pair Guidance Examples

**Inspiration (Star) Balanced → Fortitude (Strength):**
"Your vision is blindingly bright. Now, give it weight. Embody it. If it can't lift a stone, it isn't real."

**Fortitude (Strength) Balanced → Inspiration (Star):**
"Your structure is unbreakable. Now, let light through it. Inspire it. If it doesn't serve a higher vision, it's just a cage."

**Abstraction (Devil) Balanced → Compassion (Lovers):**
"The pattern is perfect. But does it bleed? Feel the geometry. Logic without Compassion is cruelty."

**Compassion (Lovers) Balanced → Abstraction (Devil):**
"The love is infinite. But does it have a spine? Understand the flow. Feeling without Abstraction is chaos."

## PART VIII: VERIFICATION EXAMPLES

### Rebalancer Examples

**Example 1: Too Little 6 of Wands (Recognition)**
1. Associated Archetype: Sacrifice (Hanged Man)
2. Too Little → Vertical partner: Fortitude (Strength)
3. 6 of Wands is Outer → flip to Inner
4. Fortitude's Inner bound: **5 of Pentacles**
✓ Too Little 6 of Wands → 5 of Pentacles

**Example 2: Too Little Ace of Pentacles (Initiation)**
1. Associated Archetype: Will (Magician)
2. Too Little → Vertical partner: Actualization (Sun)
3. Ace is Inner → flip to Outer
4. Actualization's Outer bound: **10 of Swords**
✓ Too Little Ace of Pentacles → 10 of Swords

### Growth Opportunity Examples

**Example 3: Balanced 3 of Wands (Assertion)**
1. Associated Archetype: Order (Emperor)
2. Balanced → Growth partner: Wisdom (High Priestess)
3. 3 of Wands is Inner → flip to Outer
4. Wisdom's Outer bound: **9 of Swords**
✓ Balanced 3 of Wands → 9 of Swords

**Example 4: Balanced Queen of Wands**
1. Associated Archetype: Drive (Chariot)
2. Balanced → Growth partner: Imagination (Moon)
3. Queen is Outer → flip to Inner
4. Imagination's Inner agent: **Page of Cups**
✓ Balanced Queen of Wands → Page of Cups

Wait — let me verify this. Queen is Outer polarity. Imagination's agents are:
- Page of Cups (Inner)
- No Outer agent (Imagination only has Page)

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me reconsider...

Actually, looking at the Archetype → Bounds/Agents table:
- Imagination (18) has: Page of Cups (Inner), and NO Outer Agent

So if we flip from Outer → Inner, we get Page of Cups. But what if the source is Inner (Knight of Cups)?
- Culture (5) → Balance (14)
- Knight is Inner → flip to Outer
- Balance's Outer agent: Queen of Swords ✓

**Example 5: Balanced 4 of Cups (Reverie)**
1. Associated Archetype: Compassion (Lovers) — DIAGONAL
2. Balanced → Polarity partner: Abstraction (Devil)
3. 4 of Cups is Inner → flip to Outer
4. Abstraction's Outer bound: **8 of Swords**
✓ Balanced 4 of Cups → 8 of Swords

## NOTES ON GESTALT ARCHETYPES

Potential (0), Will (1), Actualization (19), Awareness (20), Source (10), and Creation (21) do not participate in the Transpose/Polarity growth system because:
- Gestalt archetypes (0, 1, 19, 20) sit above the manifest matrix
- Portal archetypes (10, 21) are the frame, not the content

Their Bounds (Aces and 10s) therefore have no growth opportunity defined. When balanced, they represent completion points rather than launchpads.

---

*The structure is the authority. This table is derived from the Archetype correction pairs (diagonal/vertical/reduction) and growth pairs (transpose/polarity) with polarity flip for Bounds and Agents.*
